Info: 

If anyone is interested to fix it, I released the source code of CS:GO fake server redirect extensions for everyone.  To stop "business opportunity"   to make money from  server owners who are willing to pay to get their server spoofed as well  duo spammed server browser because it has went out of control. It needs gamedata update for sure its from 2021.   

Please submit PR I will update repo btw would be nice if someone added windows support as well.
